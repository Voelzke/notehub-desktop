# NoteHub – Notes & Tasks for Nextcloud

> 🇩🇪 [Deutsche Version](README.de.md)

**Your notes, tasks, and ideas in one place – built on plain Markdown files.**

NoteHub is a modern note-taking and task management app for Nextcloud. Every note is a simple `.md` file with YAML frontmatter – no proprietary format, no vendor lock-in. Your data belongs to you.

---

## ✨ What Makes NoteHub Special

### Plain Files, Full Control
NoteHub stores everything as readable Markdown files in your Nextcloud. Open them with any text editor, sync them across devices, or migrate to another tool anytime. Your notes are never locked in.

### Notes & Tasks United
Any note can become a task with a single click. Add due dates, priorities, and reminders. Color-coded indicators show urgency at a glance: 🟢 plenty of time, 🟡 getting close, 🔴 overdue.

### Address Book Integration
Link notes and tasks to contacts from your Nextcloud address book. See all notes related to a person or company. Each contact is stored with a unique ID – even two people with the same name stay distinct.

### Flexible Organization
Use tags instead of rigid folders. A note can belong to multiple topics. Connect ideas with `[[wikilinks]]` and discover relationships through automatic backlinks.

### Templates
Create your own templates or use the built-in ones for journals, meeting notes, work orders, shopping lists, and project notes. Placeholders like date and time are filled in automatically.

### Share & Collaborate
Share individual notes with other Nextcloud users. Choose between read-only and edit permissions. Shared notes appear seamlessly in the recipient's note list.

## 📁 How It Works

NoteHub stores notes as `.md` files in `NoteHub/` inside your Nextcloud user folder:

```yaml
---
title: My Note
tags: [project, ideas]
type: task
due: 2026-03-15
priority: high
contacts:
  - name: John Smith
    company: Acme Corp
    uid: abc-123-def

# My Note

Your content here in Markdown...
```

A database index ensures fast search and sorting, while the files remain the single source of truth.
